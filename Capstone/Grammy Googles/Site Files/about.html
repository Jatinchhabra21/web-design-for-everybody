            <br><p>The idea for Grammy Googles began when my Grammy sent me this email:</p>
            <a href="https://meghangutshall.com/grammygoogles/images/grammy-email-mobile.jpg" data-lightbox="grammy-email" data-title="An email from Grammy asking about the dark web">
            <img src="https://meghangutshall.com/grammygoogles/images/grammy-email-mobile.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="An email from Grammy asking about the dark web"></a>
            <br><br><p>I tried to explain it to her the best I could (after doing a little research of my own) but the dark web is a
            concept that's best understood when you have a strong grasp of basic computer and technology knowledge. I looked into
            websites specifically designed for senior citizens to learn about the Internet by breaking it down into its most basic,
            digestable form and found that there weren't many options.</p>
            <br><p>I suspect it's probably because people assume seniors who want to learn about the Internet won't know enough to
            access a website in the first place and will find their information by other means such as a book or a class. To me
            this is a big assumption.</p>
            <br><p>For many senior citizens, if they have someone (such as a child or grandchild) to get them started and guide them
            in the right direction, they will be able to research topics and learn a great deal on their own. This website is
            designed to be that starting point. Its goal is to explain some major components of technology in the most simple way
            possible in hopes that senior citizens will absorb this information and then be able to use more complex technology
            and search engines to continue their technology education.</p>
            <br><p>In addition, this website serves to fulfill the final project for the capstone class in
            <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design">Coursera's "Web Design for Everybody" certificate</a>.
            Although right now it is a basic concept, I hope to update and improve it along the way to finishing my schooling in
